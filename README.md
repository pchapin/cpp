# C++ Body of Knowledge

This repository contains my sandbox of C++ experiments and learning exercises. If any of this
code ever matures to a reasonable place, it could potentially be moved to SpicaCpp or even put
into its own repository.

Some of this material is solutions to programming assignments given to my C++ Programming
students. Because of that, this repository is private for now.
