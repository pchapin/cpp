Basic Samples
=============

This folder contains various basic C++ examples of interest to CIS-3012 students. Some of the
examples are filter programs and so this folder also contains some text files to use as input
for those programs.

The text RFCs make good fodder for filtering. An RFC such as RFC-XXXX can be downloaded with
wget using a command such as:

    wget https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfcXXXX.txt
