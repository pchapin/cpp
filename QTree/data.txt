# This is a data file in a suitable format for the query-tree program. Comments start with '#'
# and are ignored. Lines that are blank (contain only white space) are ignored. Otherwise each
# line starts with a "key" (a single word) followed by an optional value. White space delimits
# the keys from the values, but white space in a value is significant, except trailing white
# space is stripped, e.g., after comment removal.
#
# Keys are arranged in a hierarchy that is induced by the indentation. Keys at the same level
# are indented the same amount, but there is otherwise no requirements on indentation depth
# other than a requirement that top level keys must not be indented at all. Indentation must
# currently be done with only spaces. Tabs are not allowed.
#
# Possible future enhancements to this format include:
#
# + Support tabs and a mixture of tabs and spaces for indentation.
#
# + Support for keys with multiple values.
#
# + Support for a way to continue long values across multiple lines.
#
# + Support for Unicode.
#
# The example below shows calendar information for two people. However, this format can encode
# any tree-structured information. Other examples include: todo lists, outlines, organizational
# charts, etc. The format is intended to be very general.

# With the data above, values can be accessed by forming *key paths*. For example, the value
# associated with the key path "/Jill/2023-10-18/09:30am" is "Pick up Tom?" Similarly the value
# associated with "/Tom/2023-10-17T18:00" is "Take Jill out to dinner because, of course, she
# was totally awesome!"
#
# The sample program, query_tree.cpp, allows the user to look up the value associated with a key
# path.
