Skeletons
=========

This folder contains various C++ skeleton programs. These skeletons are currently all filter
programs, and so this folder also contains some text files to use as input for those programs.

The text RFCs make good fodder for filtering. An RFC such as RFC-XXXX can be downloaded with
wget using a command such as:

    wget https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfcXXXX.txt
